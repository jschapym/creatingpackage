# MSDS 431: Week 10 Assignment: Create a Go Package

- This week's assignment was to create a Go Package to compute the Trimmed Mean of a set of numbers.

- Main.go is a separate program written to test the ability of downloading this module as a package and using it effectively.

- trimmedmean.go is the package that I created that accounts for errors and trimmedmean_test.go is the test for the respective package.

- In order to use this, install the package into the go directory and write a similar code to that which is shown in main.go.
